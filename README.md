# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project uses machine learning to classify sonar signals as either a Rock or a Mine based on 60 frequency-based features.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks%29)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the `sonar.csv` dataset.
3. Run the cells to train and test the model.

## 📈 Model Used
